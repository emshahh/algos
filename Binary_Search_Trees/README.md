## WHAT IS A TREE? 
A data structure that consists of nodes in a parent/child relationship. We end up with this branch looking structure. Tress are nonlinear (there can be more than one pathway in a tree). Binary trees specifically, can only have two children.

## BINARY SEARCH TREES
- Can only have 2 children
- Numbers to the left are less than the parent, numbers to the right are greater than the parent 

## TERMINOLOGY
- Root - the top node in a tree
- Child - a node directly connected to another node when moving away from the root
- Parent - converse notion of the child
- Siblings - group of nodes with the same parents
- Lear - a node with no children
- Edge - the connection between one node and another
